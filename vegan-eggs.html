          This is probably the best product. My first taste was at a restaurant in Utah (who shall remain nameless) -- they over-cooked it as a rubbery round blob, but I've eaten enough vegan stuff to know the product had potential.  Once I cooked it at home I was <i>much</i> happier with the results. Since then I've had a hard time reliably getting my hands on it.  The biggest PROs for this product are the versatility, ease of use, and taste.  The biggest CON for this product is it's JUST not available. :D

          <ul>
            <li><b>WHAT IS IT?</b> <br> This product is a shelf stable powder made out of mostly chickpea flour.  To make the egg batter, the directions say to just add water and oil.  To cook it, fry the egg batter in an oiled pan. </li><br>
            <li><b>CAN YOU FLIP IT?</b> <br> I had a hard time flipping this the first time, but got the hang of it after waiting longer.  The above picture was my second attempt when I added in a bit of milk and coconut flour in my attempt to make a sort of "egg pancake" shape -- that worked.  On a third try, just adding the bit of coconut flour makes the difference for the egg-pancake consistency -- milk not needed.</li><br>
            <li><b>DOES IT COOK THROUGH? </b><br> Both of my first two trials looked visually as cooked but did not taste as cooked in those areas where the batter was thick.  On a third try I was more careful to only cook single serve small blobs, it worked well!  Once gaining egg-pancake consistency start to poke holes in the middle for extra caution to get it all cooked well.</li><br>
            <li><b>IS IT GOOD? </b> <br>  It has a salty and light fluffy taste.  I thought it was pretty yummy.  The thinnest crispy pieces were my favorite.  It is good enough that I will definitely keep working on perfecting my cooking technique (i.e. thickness).  Next time I will be adding garlic too because I like a bolder taste. Another idea is to add the cheese powder straight into the batter.  More updates later!  On another try I added <a href="https://www.sperofoods.co/egg">Spero Egg Salt</a> for a bolder taste and I loved it.  After separately frying up some veg, and putting it all on a low carb bagel -- it's def. my new standard!</li><br>
            <li><b>WHAT IS THAT CHEESE?</b> <br> The picture shows <a href="http://www.beyond-better.com/savory-sunflower/">Beyond Better Sunflower Sauce</a>, it is good stuff.  <a href="https://daiyafoods.com/our-foods/sauce/cheddar-sauce/">Daiya cheese sauce</a> works great too.</li><br>
            <li><b>PROS</b> <br> shelf stable, powder for baking, mixes well with other products</li><br>
            <li><b>CONS </b><br> more difficult to cook through</li><br>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><b>WHAT IS IT?</b> <br> This product is a refridgerated liquid made out of mostly pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  You must consume the bottle within a few days of opening it.  To cook it, pour the batter straight out of the bottle into an oiled pan.</li><br>
            <li><b>CAN YOU FLIP IT?</b> <br> Yes.  Right out of the bottle this product flips well.  I tried one experiment with adding milk and coconut flour but I DO NOT recommend this and I had a harder time flipping it with the extra ingredients added.</li><br>
            <li><b>DOES IT COOK THROUGH? </b><br> Yes.  Right out of the bottle this product crisps on the outside and cooks on the inside.</li><br>
            <li><b>IS IT GOOD? </b><br> It has a salty and bold taste.  I thought it was very yummy.</li><br>

            <li><b>PROS </b><br> great straight out of the bottle, no added ingredients needed just pour it, love the distinct taste</li><br>
            <li><b>CONS</b> <br> must cook whole bottle within few days, bold/distinct taste may not combine well with other products</li><br>
