    "\n",
    "[According to Julia creators,](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/) \"We love all of these languages; they are wonderful and powerful. For the work we do — scientific computing, machine learning, data mining, large-scale linear algebra, distributed and parallel computing — each [of these programming languages] is perfect for some aspects of the work and terrible for others. Each one is a trade-off.\"  In short, Julia is the next generation programming language trying to combine the best of many aspects of other computing languages.\n",
