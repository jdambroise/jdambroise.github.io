		<h2>Why is this class hard?</h2>
		Your skills must be demonstrable
			<li>Simply attending/participating isn't enough to pass.</li>
			<li>To pass you must <i>demonstrate</i> certain math skills.</li>
		        <li>Skimming or skipping parts of class can have a big negative impact.</li>
		<br>
		You must be willing to grow
		<li>Learning will challenge you in new ways.</li>
		<li>Your old study strategies may or may not work.</li>
		<li>You will need to learn new study strategies to succeed.</li>

		<h2>Why learn math?</h2>
		Humans need to be able to understand computer output
			<li>Why does this work?</li>
			<li>What is the process?</li>
			<li>What logic would give this answer?</li>
			<br>
		Reasons and rationale are equally important as final answers.	
			<li>How can we explain the math steps?</li>
			<li>How do we know calculators are correct?</li>
			<li>How could we check calculator results on our own?</li>
			<ul>
		<li>Use calculators only as a check, not as a substitute for learning.</li>
	</ul>

		<section class="slide">
		<h2>When will I use math?</h2>
			Direct uses in careers include...<br>
			<li>science research</li>
			<li>working in a science industry</li>
			<li>other math fields like finance etc.</li>
			<li>teaching</li>
			Indirect uses include cognitive skills such as ...<br>
			<li>breaking things down into parts</li>
			<li>analyzing information</li>
			<li>problem solving</li>
			<li>abstract reasoning</li>
			<li>perseverence and precision</li>

		<h2>Does communication help math?</h2>
			Talking and discussing helps with understanding the why and how.
			<li>Your perspective may be different than other students.</li>
			<li>You might recognize one part, but need to ask about another part.</li>
			<li>You can learn from seeing how other students do math.</li> <br>
			<br>
			Get to know the Professor
			<ul>
				<li>Communicate often and frequently.</li>
				<li>The Professor should know you and your needs.</li>

  		<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
      <h3>This class is like a part time job.</h3>
  		<center>
        <br> Devote at least 8 hours / week outside of class time.<br>
  			Including class time you can easily spend <u>10-12 hours / week.</u><br>
        <br>
        Question: Would one hour every single day be enough?

  	<section class="slide">
  		<h2>Homework: Due Dates are Not Start Dates</h2>
      <h3>Recommendation</h3>
      <li>One week before deadline: open and read homework</li>
      <li>5 days before deadline: complete easy problems and get help for others</li>
      <li>2-3 days befor deadline: complete over half of assignment and get help as needed</li>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>How can I succeed?</h2>
		Be okay with past failures
			<li>Remember that failure is part of success!</li>
		        <li>Reflect on past failures and ask yourself what barriers led to your failure.</li>
		<br>
	        Find new strategies for success
		<li>Success in the first few weeks is central to improving moving forward.</li>
		<li>Osmosis or passively watching is not learning!</li>
		<li>Research new study strategies that will work for you.</li>

		<h2>Advice From Students</h2>
		<!--
		<h3>"This class is ...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> ... as hard as organic chemistry."</li>
			<li> ... like a part time job."</li>
			<li> ... much harder than my previous math classes."</li>
		</ul>

		<ul>
			<li> ... stopped working full time to study more."</li>
			<li> ... gotten help for personal problems."</li>
			<li> ... made time for Prof's Student Hours."</li>

		<h2>More advice from students</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>"Finishing HW early actually helped me to understand the material better."</li>
			<li> "I didn't expect that making a summary sheet would help me, but it really did!"</li>
			<li> "Working with peers helped me to talk out the concepts, even though I was initially nervous."</li>
      <li>"Going to Student Hours, the Prof helped me clear up in five minutes something I was confused about for months!"</li>
      <li>"I had no idea how much more I could understand simply by reading and preparing before class starts.  I wish I had done that earlier."
