			<li>* 4-year Liberal Arts Colleges such as Old Westbury *</li>
  		</ul>
			<li>2-year Community Colleges</li>

		<h2>Why is this class hard?</h2>
			<li>Simply attending/participating isn't enough to pass.</li>
			<li>To pass you must demonstrate certain math skills.</li>
		        <li>Skimming or skipping parts of class can have a big negative impact.</li>
		<li>Learning will challenge you in new ways, your old strategies may or may not work.</li>

		<h2>Why learn math if we have calculators?</h2>
			<li>Why does this work?</li>
			<li>What is the process?</li>
			<li>What logic would give this answer?</li>
			<li>How can we explain the math steps?</li>
			<li>How do we know calculators are correct?</li>
			<li>How could we check calculator results on our own?</li>
			<ul>
		<li>Use calculators only as a check, not as a substitute for learning.</li>

		<h2>How does communication help us learn in math?</h2>
			<li>Your perspective may be different than other students.</li>
			<li>You might recognize one part, but need to ask about another part.</li>
			<li>You can learn from seeing how other students do math.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Communicate often and frequently.</li>
				<li>The Professor should know you and your needs.</li>

  		<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
      <h3>This class is like a part time job.</h3>
  		<center>
        <br> Devote at least 8 hours / week outside of class time.<br>
  			Including class time you can easily spend <u>10-12 hours / week.</u><br>
        <br>
        Passing this class is a certification that you have specific math skills.<br>  This will take time, practice, and communication too!

		<h3>"This class is ...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> ... as hard as organic chemistry."</li>
			<li> ... like a part time job."</li>
			<li> ... much harder than my previous math classes."</li>

		<ul>
			<li> ... working full time."</li>
			<li> ... having personal problems."</li>

    <center>IMPROVE YOUR STUDYING, ADVICE FROM STUDENTS:</center>
		<ul>
			<li>"Finishing HW early helped me to understand the material."</li>
			<li> "I didn't expect that making a summary sheet (or "concept map") would help me understand more, but it really did!"</li>
			<li> "Working with peers helped me to talk out the concepts, even though I was initially nervous."</li>
      <li>"In office hours, the Prof helped me clear up in five minutes something I was confused about for months!"</li>
      <li>"I had no idea how much more I could understand simply by reading and preparing before class starts.  I wish I had done that earlier."

		<h2>How To Navigate This Class</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>
			BEFORE CLASS - check the syllabus, read the book, do a learning activity<br>
      DURING CLASS - participate, discuss, practice problems<br>

    <h2 style="color:#ff5656">Warning on Outside Materials</h2>
			<center>Math is vast!</center>
      Outside materials:
      <br> ...  explain things differently.
      <br> ...  explain things we are not doing in this class.
      <br> ...  can be helpful!
      <br> ...  can be confusing!
      <center>
      <br>
      Use outside materials as <b>supplement not replacement</b>
      for our course materials.  <br> Ask the Prof for more details! <br> I can help resolve discrepancies when/if you find outside materials you like or want to use!

        <ul>
		<li>Students sometimes struggle with pursuing a degree their parents picked.</li>
