		<h2>Why is this class hard?</h2>
		You must show math skills "on your own"
			<li>Simply attending/participating isn't enough to pass.</li>
			<!--<li>You must <i>demonstrate</i> math skills <i>"on your own"</i>.</li>-->
		        <!--<li>Skimming or skipping parts of class can have a big negative impact.</li>-->
		<br>
		Time and communication is <i>always</i> more important than "being a genius".
			<li>Be on time and attend every class... like a job!</li>
			<li>Study ~6-8 hrs/wk outside of class on your own.... yes, seriously!</li>
			<li>Due dates are NOT start dates!  Start assignments <i>in advance.</i></li>
		<br>
		You must be willing to grow
		<li>Learning will challenge you in new ways, old study strategies may need to improve in order to succeed.</li>
		<li>For example, a student who never needed to take notes before may actually need to start!</li>	
		<li>*Question:* What study strategies worked for you? </li>

		<h2>Why learn math?</h2>
		Humans need to be able to understand computer output
			<li>Why does this work?</li>
			<li>What is the process?</li>
			<li>What logic would give this answer?</li>
			<br>
		Reasons and rationale are equally important as final answers.	
			<li>How can we explain the math steps?</li>
			<li>How do we know calculators are correct?</li>
			<li>How could we check calculator results on our own?</li>
			<ul>
		<li>Use calculators only as a check, not as a substitute for learning.</li>

		<h2>When will I use math?</h2>
			Direct uses in careers include...<br>
			<li>science research (predicting values, quantifying relationships, etc.) </li>
			<li>working in a science industry (building things, ensuring stability, etc.)</li>
			<li>other math fields like finance, data analytics, national intelligence, etc. </li>
			<li>teaching</li>
			Indirect uses include cognitive skills such as ...<br>
			<li>breaking things down into parts</li>
			<li>analyzing information</li>
			<li>problem solving</li>
			<li>abstract reasoning</li>
			<li>perseverence and precision</li>

			Talking and discussing helps with understanding the why and how.
			<li>Your perspective may be different than other students.</li>
			<li>You might recognize one part, but need to ask about another part.</li>
			<li>You can learn from seeing how other students do math.</li> <br>
			<br>
			Get to know the Professor
			<ul>
				<li>Communicate often and frequently.</li>
				<li>The Professor should know you and your needs.</li>

		<h2>Students who fail ... </h2>
			<li>usually skip class/homeworks.</li>
			<li>usually never ask "how to" math questions.</li>
			<li>usually rely heavily on online calculators.</li>
			<li>usually after initially failing decide they should just give up.</li>
		<h2>Students who succeed ... </h2>
			<li>usually stay on schedule with assignments.</li>
			<li>usually ask "how to" math questions in person.</li>
			<li>usually only use online calculators to double check their own work.</li>
			<li>usually after initially failing find a way to fix their schedule, study more, and get more help.</li>

      <h3>This class is like a part time job.  It's a committment.</h3>

        <br> Devote at least 8 hours / week outside of class time.<br>
  			Including class time you can easily spend <u>10-12 hours / week.</u><br>

		<h2>Advice From Students</h2>
		<!--
		<h3>"This class is ...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> ... as hard as organic chemistry."</li>
			<li> ... like a part time job."</li>
			<li> ... much harder than my previous math classes."</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		-->
		<h3>"I wish I had ...</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> ... stopped working full time to study more."</li>
			<li> ... gotten help for personal problems."</li>
			<li> ... made time for Prof's Office Hours."</li>
			<!--<li> ... gotten past my ego and found tutoring that I needed."</li>-->
		</ul>
		<h2>More advice from students</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>"Finishing HW earlier actually helped me to understand the material better."</li>
			<!--<li> "I didn't expect that making a summary sheet would help me, but it really did!"</li>-->
			<li> "Working with peers helped me to talk out the concepts, even though I was initially nervous."</li>
      <li>"I was confused for months, but going to Office Hours cleared things up in five minutes!"</li>
      <!--<li>"I had no idea how much more I could understand simply by reading and preparing before class starts.  I wish I had done that earlier."</li>-->

      <h2>Studying Errors</h2>
		<ul>
	<li>just watching, not doing it yourself</li>
			<li>not taking any notes, you WILL forget!</li>
      <li>just doing what you're told and not thinking about <i>why</i> it makes sense to you</li>
			<li>copying a calculator verbatim and not creating your own style</li>
			<li>giving up just because a problem has mulitple steps</li>

      Outside materials:
