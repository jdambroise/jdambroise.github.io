\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item  There are lots of interesting problems in the book!  If you feel the problems listed below are not enough review for you then explore additional problems beyond this list.  However, if you're looking for direction and focus then you can narrow your studying to the following list of problems for the purposes of  the exams.
\item Some problems below include piecewise functions.  They're good for practice but will not be on exams.
