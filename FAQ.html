          To have basic facts at your fingertips is a powerful tool for being creative on a higher level.  On the other hand, it is understandable to feel overwhelmed if a large portion of the material is very new to you.  Get the help you need, start early, and work hard.  Furthermore, there are tricks and tips that we will frequently talk about in class for how to remember certain formulas/methods.  The better you understand the reasoning behind the material, the less likely you are to characterize "knowing stuff" as "memorization".

          There is a difference between recognizing a pre-computed/provided solution is correct, versus being able to construct such a solution on your own with just a pencil and an empty sheet of paper.  The former relies on other people to do all or part of the work for you, and the latter constitutes the type of well-internalized and independent understanding we want to cultivate in this class.  A great way to improve your performance is to test yourself by attempting problems with a blank sheet of paper and no resources -- that's pretty much what the exam will be like !  Can you still do the problem under these circumstances?

          Everyone makes mistakes including myself.  There will always be small mistakes here and there, and it is important not to beat yourself up over it.  On the other hand, if you are making enough small mistakes to significantly add up to effect your grade, likely you are rushing, not rechecking answers, or you may simply not have enough background in prerequisite material.  You can improve by slowing down, being careful, studying/ practicing more, working on improving your efficiency, testing yourself at home, and rechecking your answers during exams.

          By the nature of exams themselves, yes, you can expect to be tested on a wide range of topics from the course.  This is why it is important to practice efficiency in figuring out problems.
          Often when students are spending much longer than expected periods of time doing exams, it tends to be because they are trying out numerous different methods to solve a problem.  It is a <i>good thing</i> to have a bunch of mathematical methods at your fingertips, but even better is to be able to recognize quickly which method is required.  Spending less time debating various methods shows that you have mastered the material at a high level.  This is the type of mastery we want to work on developing in this class.  Create daily study habits, read the book, ask questions frequently, prepare in advance, test yourself in exam-like scenarios etc..

          Exams are a random selection of course material that you are expected to have mastered, and I write exams expecting A-performing-students to earn an A, B-performing-students to earn a B, etc..  In other courses you may come across differing expectations.  For example, in a course I once took as a student, A-students were expected to get about 30% of the exam questions correct.  This is because the professor preferred to ask new and unexpected questions that the students had never seen before.  This works well for a particular type of teaching style, but I prefer not to teach this way.  It's just not my style.

          Studying is an extended activity that when done correctly takes much more devotion than one single multi-hour pre-test study session.  The most effective way to prepare for exams is to create daily and weekly consistent study habits spanning the entire semester.  If you have done this and are still experiencing problems with performance, seriously consider whether you are mathematically prepared to take this course and/or whether you are in need of more substantial extra help in identifying your mathematical weaknesses.  Remember that the earlier you address the crux of the issue and the more help you seek, the better chance you will have of doing well.  These are the types of conversations I love having in office hours because it gives me a way to really help you concretely !<br>
