In my personal opinion vegan cheese is tricky and can sometimes taste questionably.  I advise you to try things out in small quantities and to keep an open mind about vegan cheese in general even if you try one that you dislike.<br>
                <br>
                <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/our-products/creamy-sheese">Scheese</a> and <a href="http://www.daiyafoods.com/">Daiya</a> vegan cheeses have recently gained popularity, but in my opinion they will be surpassed by the newest better evolutions of vegan cheeses. My latest favorites are <a href="http://www.treelinecheese.com/products/">Treeline vegan spreadable cheeses</a> and <a href="http://fieldroast.com/chaostory/">Chao sliced cheeses</a>.  Also, <a href="http://followyourheart.com/products/mozzarella-style/">this vegan mozzarella</a> is amazing and very hard to stop eating (however I'm not a fan <i>at all</i> of the cheddar version of the same product).  <a href="http://www.tofutti.com/dairy-free-cheeses/slices/">Tofutti sliced vegan cheese</a> is a great one for sandwiches, and <a href="https://wayfarefoods.com/shop/cheese/">Wayfare Cheddar Spread</a>
                is my one of my favorites for crackers.  This is also a good place to reemphasize amazingly delicious homemade vegan mac and cheeze.  Until recently I would never have recommended buying store bought vegan mac and cheese, but I just found the new <a href="http://earthbalancenatural.com/product/vegan-white-cheddar-mac-cheese/">Earth Balance mac and cheese</a> and it's great!  In case you are set on homemade, <a href="http://veganyumyum.com/2009/01/mac-cheeze-take-2/">this recipe using a blended nutritional yeast, earth balance, mustard, cashew, miso, etc. mix as cheese</a> is simply amazing and addicting.<br>

                Meat substitutes get a bad rep because they take practice to cook skillfully, but what delicious steak or salmon or turkey doesn't also take skill and practice?  The most reliable places to try out perfectly prepared, amazing vegan mock meats are at designated vegan or vegetarian asian restaurants.  A few examples in the Boston area are
                <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=4965">My Thai Vegan Cafe on Beacon St.</a> or <a href="http://www.grasshoppervegan.com/">The Grasshopper Restaurant in Allston</a>.  Great vegan meat substitutes are everywhere, though.  You'll be surprised what you find if you keep your eyes open.

This may not be the case for all white and brown sugars, but really being sure about the details takes research.  For sure, cane sugar and raw sugar are vegan.  I do very much like my coffee regularly so; if raw or cane sugar is not available and I am feeling like unsweetened coffee will make me feel a little grumpy; I do often conceed and have a little sugar.  We all have our vices!  :)  More recently I have switched to coconut sugar or monk fruit sugar! <br><br></td>

                <td>Honey</td>
                <td><br>Since honey is a bee byproduct it is not vegan.  Another argument that vegans make is that the traditional practice of clipping the queen's wings to prevent the bees from swarming (i.e. flying away) does not constitute ethical treatment of bees.  Some beekeepers do not clip wings, and hence let the bees fly away as they please.  I think that in this latter case the beekeeper must purchase a queen after the bees depart of their own free will.  This seems equally problematic in terms of a coherent scheme for vegan morality since my understanding is that the queen is purchased and comes in the mail in a box!  The reality is that each vegan makes their own personal choice regarding whether or not to eat honey from the latter, arguably more ethical, beekeeper.  Honey is not so important to me, so my personal choice is to just omit it by default.  One can easily find vegan substitutes for baking or for adding sweetness to your tea.  Some examples of vegan sweeteners include maple syrup, agave, or brown rice syrup.<br><br></td>
