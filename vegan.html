    <blockquote>
      Me, you, and meat-eaters too!  A popular myth about vegan food is that it is boring, tasteless, and mostly consistent of salads.  On the contrary, vegans desire filling and wholesome foods just like meat-eaters do!  Some examples are peanut noodle salads, macadamia nut creamy dip sauce, tamari almond stuffed portobello mushrooms, applie pie, orzo stuffed peppers, and more!  Vegan food is creative food and that's something everyone can appreciate.<br>

    <center>
      <h2>Why</h2>
    </center>
    <blockquote>
      Strict veganism is a personal choice that is not well suited for
      everyone. There are very good arguments both for
       and against long term veganism.  I choose veganism it because the food energizes me; I love the food!  Also, it's a fun and interesting way to experience the world.  That being said, it is impossible for anyone to be 100&#37; fully vegan.  The best one can do is eat things that are vegan to the best of your knowledge and always be re-evaluating how veganism makes you feel and whether it suits you.  I don't think you should become vegan unless you want to be vegan, but trying out (and possibly getting addicted to) some amazing vegan meals is a must for all humans!  <br>

    Coffee with soy creamer and baguettes slathered with earth balance --
    while both delicious -- should <i>not</i> be the sole ingredients of a vegan
    diet.  Vegans need the same nutrients meat-eaters do.  The following
    links address commonly held vegan beliefs regarding commonly cited
    deficiencies of the vegan diet.  The quick and dirty way to use this
    information is to <b><i>click</i></b> the links, then <b><i>scroll</i></b> down 'till you see a chart of foods, then <b><i>eat</i></b> those foods!  After your belly is happy and full, go back and read the bulk the websites at a leisurely pace.<br>

    For omega-3 fatty acids, this is <a href="https://silk.com/products/dha-omega-3-soymilk">one of my fave soymilks</a>.

In my personal opinion vegan cheese is tricky and can sometimes taste questionably.  I advise you to try things out in small quantities and to keep an open mind about vegan cheese in general even if you try one that you dislike.<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/our-products/creamy-sheese">Scheese</a> and <a href="http://www.daiyafoods.com/">Daiya</a> vegan cheeses have recently gained popularity, but in my opinion they will be surpassed by the newest better evolutions of vegan cheeses. My latest favorites are <a href="http://www.treelinecheese.com/products/">Treeline vegan spreadable cheeses</a> and <a href="http://fieldroast.com/chaostory/">Chao sliced cheeses</a>.  Also, <a href="http://followyourheart.com/products/mozzarella-style/">this vegan mozzarella</a> is amazing and very hard to stop eating (however I'm not a fan <i>at all</i> of the cheddar version of the same product).  <a href="http://www.tofutti.com/dairy-free-cheeses/slices/">Tofutti sliced vegan cheese</a> is a great one for sandwiches, and <a href="https://wayfarefoods.com/shop/cheese/">Wayfare Cheddar Spread</a> is my one of my favorites for crackers.  This is also a good place to reemphasize amazingly delicious homemade vegan mac and cheeze.  Until recently I would never have recommended buying store bought vegan mac and cheese, but I just found the new <a href="http://earthbalancenatural.com/product/vegan-white-cheddar-mac-cheese/">Earth Balance mac and cheese</a> and it's great!  In case you are set on homemade, <a href="http://veganyumyum.com/2009/01/mac-cheeze-take-2/">this recipe using a blended nutritional yeast, earth balance, mustard, cashew, miso, etc. mix as cheese</a> is simply amazing and addicting.<br>
        <br>
        Here are some recipes I tell myself I will have time to try one day:<br>

      <td>Honey</td>
      <td>Since honey is a bee byproduct it is not vegan.  Another argument that vegans make is that the traditional practice of clipping the queen's wings to prevent the bees from swarming (i.e. flying away) does not constitute ethical treatment of bees.  Some beekeepers do not clip wings, and hence let the bees fly away as they please.  I think that in this latter case the beekeeper must purchase a queen after the bees depart of their own free will.  This seems equally problematic in terms of a coherent scheme for vegan morality since my understanding is that the queen is purchased and comes in the mail in a box!  The reality is that each vegan makes their own personal choice regarding whether or not to eat honey from the latter, arguably more ethical, beekeeper.  Honey is not so important to me, so my personal choice is to just omit it by default.  One can easily find vegan substitutes for baking or for adding sweetness to your tea.  Some examples of vegan sweeteners include maple syrup, <a href="http://www.wholesomesweeteners.com/brands/Wholesome_Sweeteners/Organic_Raw_Blue_Agave.html">agave</a> and brown rice syrup.</td>

    <i>
    Most people agree that the most nutritious and tasty foods are whole and unprocessed foods.<br>
    For example, a handcrafted nut or lentil burger beats a frozen Boca burger any day! <br>
    Also, I have read many warnings about consuming an excess of soy products so<br>
    I try to save tofu, soy milk, Tofutti ice cream or vegan hot dogs as a treat for special occasions.

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.orgran.com/products/vegan-easy-egg-2/">Link to Orgran's product page.</a></li>
      <li>WHAT IS IT? <br> This product is a shelf stable powder made out of mostly chickpea flour.  To make the egg batter, the directions say to just add water.  To cook it, fry the egg batter in an oiled pan. </li>
      <li>CAN YOU FLIP IT? <br> I had a hard time flipping this with only the water added, as was directed by the box.  The above picture was my second try when I added in a bit of milk and coconut flour in my attempt to make a sort of "egg pancake" shape.  It worked.  I recommend this method. (Sorry I didn't measure.)</li>
      <li>DOES IT COOK THROUGH? <br> Both of my trials looked visually as cooked but did not taste as cooked in those areas where the batter was thick.  I still need to do another trial where I make the total fried amount much thinner to see if the overall result can be better.</li>
      <li>IS IT GOOD?  <br>  It has a salty and light fluffy taste.  I thought it was pretty yummy.  The thin crispy pieces were my favorite.  It is good enough that I will definitely keep working on perfecting my cooking technique (i.e. thickness).  Next time I will be adding garlic too because I like a bolder taste. Another idea is to add the cheese powder straight into the batter.  More updates later!</li>
      <li>WHAT IS THAT CHEESE? <br> The picture shows <a href="http://www.beyond-better.com/savory-sunflower/">Beyond Better Sunflower Sauce</a>, it is good stuff.</li>
      <li>PROS <br> shelf stable, powder for baking, mixes well with other products</li>
      <li>CONS <br> long cooktime, more difficult to cook through, thick parts can taste uncooked</li>

      <li>WHAT IS IT? <br> This product is a refridgerated liquid made out of mostly pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  You must consume the bottle within a few days of opening it.  To cook it, pour the batter straight out of the bottle into an oiled pan.</li>
      <li>CAN YOU FLIP IT? <br> Yes.  Right out of the bottle this product flips well.  I tried one experiment with adding milk and coconut flour but I DO NOT recommend this and I had a harder time flipping it with the extra ingredients added.</li>
      <li>DOES IT COOK THROUGH? <br> Yes.  Right out of the bottle this product crisps on the outside and cooks on the inside.</li>
      <li>IS IT GOOD? <br> It has a salty and bold taste.  I thought it was very yummy.</li>
      <li>WHAT IS THAT CHEESE? <br> The picture shows <a href="https://violifefoods.com/us/product/just-like-cheddar-shreds/">Violife Just Like Chedder Shreds</a>, it is good stuff.</li>
      <li>PROS <br> great straight out of the bottle, no added ingredients needed just pour it, distinct taste</li>

    *I am a pretty lazy person when it comes to cooking (hence <b><i>click-scroll-eat</i></b> above).  Most of the time I prefer to be brooding about a math problem or choking someone out <a href="http://www.bjjfighter.com/">on the mat</a>.

    I don't actually have this last book, but recently I went to the
    restaurant in Toronto, ON.  It was AMAZING!  It was the best vegan food I
     have had in my life.  Where else can you go and find FIVE CHOICES of
    vegan burgers?!?  Nowhere, my friends, no where.

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Salads can be boring.  Choose greens you are excited to eat like:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Pea Greens!</li>
        <li>Red Curly Kale!</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Use something yummy like <a href="http://www.kite-hill.com/our-food/artisanal-delicacy/">Kite Hill Vegan Ricotta cheese</a></li>
      <li>Add fresh tiny tomatoes, black olives, and walnuts or spiced pepitas!</li>

    <h3><u>Jennie's Awesome Miso Garlic Soup</u></h3>
    <img = src="images/garlicmisosoup.jpg" width=40% height=40%><br>
    I list this recipe per-two-cups, so multiply by however many cups you desire.  <img src="emo/classic-happy-smiley-face-emoticon.png" width=2% height=2%> <br>
    I'm not sure how most people manage to make miso soup that is smooth, mine always comes out lumpy. :/  <br>
    So I devised this GENIUS PLAN:  put the following items <i> in a blender !!! </i>
    <ul>
      <li> 2 cups of water</li>
      <li> 2 tbsp white miso paste</li>
      <li> 1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
      <li> 2 tsp veg. broth base (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    Next boil water to cook noodles.  Once boiling shut off heat and soak one block of <a href="http://thaifooddirect.co.uk/mama-instant-rice-noodles-225g.html"> Mama's instant rice noodles</a> for two minutes.<br>  Drain the noodles.
    Finally put everything below into a pot and simmer it all, heating gently until warm enough to eat.
    <ul>
      <li> the miso/garlic/broth mixture from the blender</li>
      <li> the drained cooked rice noodles</li>
      <li> one handful of fresh chopped bok choy leaves</li>
      <li> one handful of fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li> one handful of small cubed firm tofu</li>
    </ul>
    If you want a thicker soup you can put the tofu in with the blender step !!  In the above picture I did just that. <br>

      <li>Press a block of tofu for about 15mins.  You can do this by stacking a plate and some cans on top of the fresh block of tofu.</li>
      <li>Cut the block into slices.</li>
      <li>Soak each slice for a few seconds into a pool of soy sauce.</li>
      <li>"Bread" each slice using a mix of nutritional yeast, garlic powder, curry powder, and tumeric. (sorry, I didn't measure! use your judgement)</li>
      <li>Lay each piece flat and bake at 400-deg for 20-25 mins.</li>

      <li>Pick your spices to taste: paprika, onion powder, mustard powder, salt, pepper, and/or nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>I prefer to refrigerate without adding any sauces, then add sauces on serving (stays good longer).  For sauces, pick your preference(s) to taste: vegan mayo, dijon mustard, and/or tahini.

    <h3><u>Mac and Cheeze (Pic shows cauliflower &amp; potato version)</u></h3>
    <img = src="images/caulimacchzz.jpg" width=50% height=50%><br>
    <br>
    I've tried many different versions of vegan mac and cheeze, the most successful of which came from the <a href="http://veganyumyum.com/?s=mac+and+cheese">VeganYumYum site</a>.  Eventually I came to slightly modify the recipe based on the ingredients and dish size that have the highest probability of being found in my kitchen.  Here goes, this makes 8 servings:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 deg. </li>
    <li>If you want the pasta version, make one 16oz package of <a href="http://www.vitacost.com/Tinkyada-Brown-Rice-Pasta-Spirals-16-oz">brown rice pasta</a> according to package, but cook for 2-3 minutes less than instructions (it will finish cooking in the oven).  Any pasta is ok here.</li>
    <li>If you want the cauliflower version, cut up one large cauliflower head into small pieces.  Then boil the pieces for about 5 minutes (it will finish cooking in the oven).</li>
    <li>If you want the potato version, cut up 7-8 medium size potatoes.  Then boil for about 5 minutes (it will finish cooking in the oven).</li>
    <li>Mix the following cheeze sauce ingredients in food processor or blender:
    <ul>
    <li>handful of raw unroasted/unsalted cashews</li>
    <li>1/2 can chickpeas</li>
    <li>1 small carrot</li>
    <li>one inch x one inch small cut piece of daiya gouda style vegan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Earth Balance margarine</li>
    <li>2 tbsp miso</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tahini</li>
    <li>2/3 cup nutritional yeast</li>
    <li>2 tbsp tomato paste or 2 small salad tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 tsp dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 tsp garlic powder or fresh garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>1 tsp tumeric</li>
    <li>small amount of water, just enough to blend smoothly</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mix partially cooked pasta or cauliflower with cheeze sauce in 2 quart casserole dish.</li>
    <li>Optionally top with bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Potato Salad</u></h3>
    <img = src="images/potatosalad.jpg" width=40% height=40%><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Clean and cut 3lbs of potatoes into 1 inch cubes, then boil in large pot for 20-25 minutes or until pleasantly tender and eatable.  Most recipes comment here that the cubes must be evenly sized or else the salad can be part crunchy part mushy -- slight variances are OK I think, but big differences in size may have an effect.</li>
      <li>Drain potatoes and let cool.</li>
      <li>Combine in large bowl:
        <ul>
          <li>2 finely diced celery stalks</li>
          <li>1 finely diced large carrot</li>
          <li>1 finely chopped small onion</li>
          <li>1 15oz can of chickpeas, rinsed</li>
          <li>1 cup veganaise</li>
          <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh dill</li>
          <li>1 tsp mustard powder</li>
          <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
          <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After potatoes completely cooled, mix potatoes with other ingredients.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Quiche</u></h3>
    <img = src="images/quiche.jpg" width=40% height=40%><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 deg.</li>
      <li>In skillet saute the following until fragrant.  Don't overcook here as some additional cooking will take place in the oven.
        <ul>
          <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
          <li>1 finely diced small onion</li>
          <li>5-6 finely diced baby bella mushrooms</li>
          <li>2 cups chopped spinach leaves</li>
          <li>1 finely diced large carrot</li>
          <li>4-5 finely diced brocolli florets</li>
          <li>10 chopped fresh basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In food processor, blend the following ingredients in the following order (dry first, wet later):
        <ul>
          <li>1/2 cup raw unsalted cashews</li>
          <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast flakes</li>
          <li>1 tsp oregano</li>
          <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
          <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
          <li>1 16oz package firm tofu</li>
          <li>1/2 block <a href="http://followyourheart.com/products/mozzarella-3/">vegan gourmet cheese</a></li>
          <li>few tbsp unsweetened vegan milk, just enough to help the blending -- not too much or quiche won't firm up later</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Mix up the sauteed ingredients and processed ingredients, then plop it all into a vegan pie crust.  I like to use a store-bought crust -- you can also find or make a gluten free crust.</li>
      <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes until toothpick inserted comes out mostly clean.</li>

    <h3><u>Deviled "Eggs" ... that are really potatoes</u></h3>
    This recipe came from my sister -- I'm not sure where she found it but everyone in the family was raving about these snacks!
    <ul>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 deg.</li>
      <li>Peel and half 6 new potatoes.  New potatoes are also called Klamath Potatoes -- they should be sort of egg shaped.</li>
      <li>Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>Coat all sides of each potato with olive oil. Place potatoes face down on the cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake for about 45 minutes, or until soft (but not too mushy). </li>
      <li>While the potatoes are roasting, mix together:
        <ul>
          <li>4 tablespoons vegan mayonnaise</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard</li>
          <li>1 to 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
          <li>dash hot sauce</li>
          <li>dash garlic powder</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>dash turmeric, optional, for yellow color</li>
        </ul>
      <li>When the potatoes are done, allow to cool a bit, and then use a sharp knife to cut into the flat side of each potato and hollow it out with a spoon. You want to be left with a little cup-shaped potato. </li>
      <li>Add the scooped-out potato mash to your mayo/mustard mix and blend well. You can then fill the hollowed out potato shells with the mixture -- pipe it on with a cake decorating bag or just blop it in there.</li>
      <li>Dust each potato with paprika.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Avocado Garbonzo Salad for lettuce wrap</u></h3>
    Here's a picture (I forgot the lettuce wrap!).<br>
    <img = src="images/lettwrapsalad.jpg" width=45% height=45%><br>
    <br>
    First marinate the "vegan feta" by letting the following items sit in a bowl for 10 minutes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li> 1/2 block of firm tofu, cubed</li>
      <li> 2 tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li> 2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li> 1 tsp oregano or other green spice</li>
      <li> few dashes of black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    Mix in a bowl the following items:<br>
    <ul>
      <li> vegan feta (see above)</li>
      <li> 1 can of rinsed, drained pinto beans</li>
      <li> 1 can of rinsed, drained chick peas</li>
      <li> 1 can of rinsed, drained tomatoes (chop if necessary)</li>
      <li> 1/2 big white onion, chopped (maybe 1 red onion chopped would be better...)</li>
      <li> 2 cups of raw kale, sliced into strips</li>
      <li> 2 handfuls of fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li> 1 tbsp <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hampton-Creek-Sriracha-Gluten-Container/dp/B00KBD1EOW/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1437008766&sr=1-1&keywords=sriracha+just+mayo">sriracha vegan mayo, just mayo brand</a></li>

    </ul>
    The above mix will hold well in the fridge!  Before serving add to individual dishes:<br>
    <ul>
      <li> diced avocado </li>
      <li> dust paprika on top </li>
    </ul>
