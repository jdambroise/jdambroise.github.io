      How to make a study sheet for an exam
    </h1>
    <p align="center">
      Before each exam make a list of formulas, ideas, examples, and more <br>
      that includes everything you should know for the exam. <br>
       Follow the steps below!
    </p>
    <p align="center">
      A study sheet can be any length.<br>  The best study sheets are  <strong>comprehensive</strong> (covers every single topic) and <strong>concise</strong> (avoids repititon).
    </p>
  </div>

    <h2>Step I. Review Blackboard<br> -- 1-2 weeks before exam --</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>Find out:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>which book sections are included on your exam</li>
        <li>which days those sections were covered in class</li>
        <li>which HW &amp; quiz assignments covered those sections</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Gather up:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>the textbook</li>
        <li>all relevant class notes</li>
        <li>all relevant HW &amp; quiz assignments</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h2>Step II. Record all crucial info<br> -- 1 week before exam --</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>For each section included on your exam, write on your study sheet:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>crucial formulas, ideas, and theorems used in this section.</li>
        <li>list of steps you would follow to solve problems from that section.</li>
        <li>one or two representative examples from that section written out in full detail.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>

    <h2>Step III. Review &amp; refine<br> -- 2-3 days before exam --</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>Repeat Step I.</li>
      <li>Examine all materials and look for concepts missing from your study sheet.  Fix your study sheet.</li>
      <li>Examine the study sheet and look for excessive repitition.  Fix your study sheet.</li>
    </ul>

    Other Study Sheets
  </h1>
  <p align="center">
    Make a study sheet for any topic!  Here are some examples.
  </p>
  </div>

  <center>

    <h2>Basic Graphs</h2>
    <div align="center">
This study sheet should contain graphs of basic functions such as:  exponentials like (1/2)^x , (1/3)^x ,2^x,3^x ,e^x , ... ; polynomials including monomials like x^2,x^3,..., as well as polynomials with multiple terms such as y=x^2 -x, or y=x^2 -15x+56 or other factorable polynomials; rational functions like y=1/x, or y=1/x^2 , etc.; logarithms of various bases; all trig functions; absolute value functions; piecewise functions; shifting and scaling rules and examples.
</div>
<br>

<h2>Limits</h2>
    <div align="center">
This study sheet should include basic limit rules and examples such as limit laws (see book!), limits of polynomials, rational functions, exponentials, logarithms, trig functions and more.  To jog your memory and get started you may want to check out the limits study sheets available here <a href="http://www.jdambroise.com/studyaids">www.jdambroise.com/studyaids</a> and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b59Dd2P_KS0&index=2&list=PLKcumqm3vTNo_NH8VZfPNbszFheaYaBPm">this video</a>.  </div>
    <br>



<h2>Derivatives &amp; Anti-derivatives</h2>
    <div align="center">
This study sheet should contain all handy formulas for derivatives and anti-derivative basics including chain rule, product rule, trig derivatives, and more.  For the anti-derivatives, include the basics such as anti-derivatives of power functions, polynomials, trig functions, inverse trig functions, logs, and exponentials.   To jog your memory and get started you may want to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJqN7jm2Snk&index=4&list=PLKcumqm3vTNo_NH8VZfPNbszFheaYaBPm">this video</a> and check out the derivatives and anti-derivatives study sheets available here:  <a href="http://www.jdambroise.com/studyaids">www.jdambroise.com/studyaids</a>. <br> NOTE:  if you have not learned anti-derivatives, just focus on making a derivatives study sheet. </div>
