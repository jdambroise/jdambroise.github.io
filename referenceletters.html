      FYI:  Asking For A Reference Letter
    </h1>
  </div>

  <center>

    <h2>When you should ask</h2>
    <div align="left">
      Ask a Professor with whom you have worked closely for a reference letter.  
      Ideally you should have done well in a few classes with the Professor, 
      and you should have had contact with the Professor during office hours, 
      for an extended project, and/or in consultation regarding your desired career path. 
      If you are not sure whether you should ask a Professor for a reference letter,
      go ahead and ask your Professor their opinion about it.  Sometimes a Professor might say 
      no, but they can still give you a good idea about another Professor you should ask.  Again,
      think about which Professors you worked closely with, who know you well, and who have seen some 
      of your best academic work -- those are the Professors you should ask for reference letters.

    <h2>Be emotionally mature.</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>Students shoulProvide the Professor a link to the program or job to which you are applying.</li>
      <li>Take good notes and study your notes.</li>
      <li>Understand that learning is an imperfect process.</li>
      <li>Be patient, persistent, and start early!</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Get help when you need help.</li>
      <li>Don't fear questions, welcome them!</li>
      <li>Find some math friends and discuss class material.</li>
      <li>Admit what you don't know and then find out how to fix it.</li>
      <li>Understand the consequences of procrastination.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </div>

    <h2>Craft a good question.</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li> Reference a particular page/paragraph/line of the book, or a point in class notes.</li>
      <li> Explain what you understand so far.</li>
      <li> Then explain what part you have a question on.</li>
      <li> Show a homework problem you have half-completed and explain where you got stuck.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </div>

    <h2>Questions to avoid</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>"I haven't read the book yet, can you teach me all of topic X in office hours?"</li>
      <li>"I missed class and didn't get notes from my peer, can you teach me all of topic Y in office hours?"</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
