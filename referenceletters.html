      How To Ask For A Reference Letter
    </h1>
  </div>

  <center>

    <h2>When you should ask</h2>
    <div align="left">
      Ask a Professor with whom you have worked closely for a reference letter.  
      Ideally you should have done well in a few classes with the Professor, 
      and you should have had contact with the Professor during office hours, 
      for an extended project, and/or in consultation regarding your desired career path. 
    <ul>
      <li>Students shoulProvide the Professor a link to the program or job to which you are applying.</li>
      <li>Take good notes and study your notes.</li>
      <li>Understand that learning is an imperfect process.</li>
      <li>Be patient, persistent, and start early!</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </div>

    <h2>Be emotionally mature.</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>Get help when you need help.</li>
      <li>Don't fear questions, welcome them!</li>
      <li>Find some math friends and discuss class material.</li>
      <li>Admit what you don't know and then find out how to fix it.</li>
      <li>Understand the consequences of procrastination.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </div>

    <h2>Craft a good question.</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li> Reference a particular page/paragraph/line of the book, or a point in class notes.</li>
      <li> Explain what you understand so far.</li>
      <li> Then explain what part you have a question on.</li>
      <li> Show a homework problem you have half-completed and explain where you got stuck.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    </div>

    <h2>Questions to avoid</h2>
    <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li>"I haven't read the book yet, can you teach me all of topic X in office hours?"</li>
      <li>"I missed class and didn't get notes from my peer, can you teach me all of topic Y in office hours?"</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
