      FYI:  Asking For A Reference Letter
    </h1>
  </div>

  <center>

    <h2>When you should ask</h2><br><br>
    <div align="left">
      Ask a Professor with whom you have worked closely for a reference letter.  
      Ideally you should have done well in a few classes with the Professor, 
      and you should have had contact with the Professor during office hours, 
      for an extended project, and/or in consultation regarding your desired career path. 
      If you are not sure whether you should ask a Professor for a reference letter,
      go ahead and ask your Professor their opinion about it.  Sometimes a Professor might say 
      no, but they can still give you a good idea about another Professor you should ask.  Again,
      think about which Professors you worked closely with, who know you well, and who have seen some 
      of your best academic work -- those are the Professors you should ask for reference letters.

    <h2>Providing the materials</h2><br><br>
    <div align="left">
      If a Professor agrees to write a reference letter for you, they will need some information first.  
      For each individual program or job to which you are applying, provide your Professor with: 
    <ul>
      <li>a link to the program or job description</li>
      <li>the deadline for the reference letter</li>
      <li>the submission details for how the reference letter will be submitted</li>
    </ul>
    Most reference letters these days are submitted through online application processes.  You enter the 
      Professor's name into your References list, and the online system will send an upload request to the 
      Professor's email.  Occasionally letters are requested to be sent via email to a particular manager person or 
      academic head, in that case you would provide the verifiable email address to your Professor where they can send their 
      letter.
